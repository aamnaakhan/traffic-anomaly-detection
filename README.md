Final Year Project - Traffic Anomaly Detection using YOLOv11 + Custom Model + Flask + React

## Features

- Emergency vehicle detection  
- Wrong-way driving & overspeeding alerts  
- Helmet violation & footpath intrusion detection  
- Vehicle counting & prohibited area detection  
- Video processing with alert logs

- ## Tech Stack

- **YOLOv11 / YOLOv10** for object detection  
- **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**  
- **Flask (backend)** + **React.js (frontend)**  
- **MongoDB** for data storage

- ## How It Works
